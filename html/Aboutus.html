        <p>London School of Trends is a premier institution offering its knowledge and catering to the needs of talented
            minds for over two decades. The founder, Dhananjay Somra, is a fashion entrepreneur who has built his brand
            with the vision that art has infinite possibilities. There is no set formula for any individual. Every
            individual has an artistic journey and narrative. Furthermore, here at LST, we guide them to achieve their
            fullest potential. With rich industry knowledge and experience and aworld-class faculty, we are proud to
            have moulded minds that have become leading names in the fashion industry.</p>
        <p>LST has spread its wings with unique collaborations and offerings across the globe, allowing students to
            learn from short courses in London in Fashion & design to varied online courses across the world.
        </p>
        <p>The teaching methodology amplifies student-teacher interaction with project-based assignments and hands-on
            practical training. The school propounds a symbiotic environment where students are encouraged to think
            freely and explore innumerable possibilities to create art in their field of choice. The students are given
            an experiential curriculum, and introspection of how the industry works at the west, equipping them for the
            real world of the fashion and design industry. LST also creates a one of a kind opportunity where students
            and fashion enthusiasts can witness fashion weeks at the Fashion Hot Spots of the world; New York, London,
            Milan and Paris. The first fashion school to ever pioneer and create a curated experience for their students
            and fashion enthusiasts across the world to be able to witness the avalanche of fashions' best.
        </p>
        <p>LST works closely with institutions globally. LST has a unique foreign outreach program designed with special
            care to reach out to candidates across the globe and ensure that they get the best industry training that a
            city like London can offer with the most cost-effective fee structure. Students that sign up with LST are
            given a world-class experience in the Fashion capital with the best teachers and accommodation. We encourage
            an atmosphere for students to grow and reach their full potential and have specially curated programs to
            suit their educational need with a stable curriculum to help them understand the colourful, vibrant fashion
            culture of the capital. Without further ado, join us at LST and answer your calling. Be an Artist!</p>
